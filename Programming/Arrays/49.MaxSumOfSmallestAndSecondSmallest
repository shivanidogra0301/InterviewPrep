Solution, is ans will always with consecutive pair because let's say
[5,6] = 5+6 is ans
now case when 5 8 6, here ans will be max of 5 and 6+ middle again consecutive
other case 5 8 9 6, there 5 6 cannot be ans, 89 will be the ans, consecutive
final case 5 1 2 6, here's as well there 5 6 cannot be ans, it will 2 6 consectuive

            omax = Math.max(sum,omax);
        }
        return omax;
    }
