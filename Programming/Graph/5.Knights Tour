given a matrix print a matrix having moves of knights, such that
each vertex is vis once and we pisit all the cells using knights move.

solution:
8 directions call dfs, for vis use cell[r][c] = move, now if move = row*col means all
cells are visited. this is our solution. and don't foget o remove change when backtracking
