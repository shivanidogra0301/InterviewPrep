Given a matrix where 2 means oranges are rotten 1 means fresh 0 means nothing.
So we want min time to make all oranges rotten. It is very similar to spread infections
question but here;s a catch that there can be more than one rotten orange, so it is
a multisource bfs problem.

1. We will put all the rotten oranges as source in a queue.
2. now to calculate tim we when one level is done, i.e all the rotten oranges source
we put in a queue in starting are executed. so instead of  doing normal bfs, we will
righ the code in such a way, thawe can calculate the level.
3. Now there can be case after doinf it, some oranges are not rotten, so that's we
will keep a count of orages that turned into rotten to know the answer


keyPoint, hme agar multiple source m level se ans nikalna ho to 2 ways pair class main
ek level rkhlo, and usko prev level+1 kro ya fir level order m chlake level count krlo
both are same
