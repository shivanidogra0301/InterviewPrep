https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/highway-billboard-problem/

simple application of lis, so hr board ki position pe jake dekhneng vo piche kisme
jud skta hai, or unme se jiska max revenue hai usko add krdenge current revenue if nott
then only current revenue.
o(n^2) o(n)

now other solution, what if we create a array of size maxmiles+1.

now jahan board ni hai, vha simple dp[i] = dp[i-1]
if board exist we have 2 choice, inc?  dp[i] = dp[i-t-1] + rev[i]
exc dp[i] =dp[i-1]
